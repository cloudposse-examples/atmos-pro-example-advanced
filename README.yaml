  > ### Automated Terraform Management & Orchestration Software (ATMOS)

  Atmos simplifies complex cloud architectures and DevOps workflows into [intuitive CLI commands](https://atmos.tools/category/cli).
  Its strength in managing [DRY configurations at scale](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/) is supported by robust
  [design patterns](https://atmos.tools/design-patterns/), comprehensive [documentation](https://atmos.tools/), and a
  [passionate community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/), making it a versatile [tool for both startups and enterprises](https://cloudposse.com/).
  Atmos is extensible to accommodate any tooling, including enterprise-scale Terraform, and includes
  [policy controls](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/components/validation), [vendoring](https://atmos.tools/core-concepts/vendoring/),
  and [GitOps capabilities](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions) out of the box. Everything is open source and free.
